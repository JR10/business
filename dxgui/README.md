dxGUI - a GUI system for MTA
============================
dxGUI is a work-in-progress GUI system built for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas.

**Note:** Due to the current limitations in MTA that evolves around Lua environments and Object Orientated Programming, this GUI system only works within one resource and can only be used by one resource. We do not recommend running multiple dxGUI scripts (across different resources or within a single resource) as this may cause a significant impact to visitors of your server. We recommend that all important logic that utilises the GUI exists within a centralised resource (take care for security, keep secure scripts away from the main GUI).

want factors:
-------------
- config files!
- dynamic variables!
- new unique GUI elements!
- an easy way to install or update dxGUI!
- a fully themeable and extendable system!
- the most optimised GUI system MTA offers!
- and super cool 3D gui capabilities!!!111!1
